# stock-analysis
Challenge 2

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve analyze the stock data for helping his parents. We set Steve up to run a script to compare 2017 and 2018 stock data, and then refactored the code to utilize an index variable.

## Results
The results we found for Steve were that 2017 had almost the opposite outcome vs 2018. 2017 provided almost all postivie returns (TERP being the only negative), whereas 2018 provided almost all negative returns (ENPH and RUN being the only positive).

The tables below show the results by year:

Further, the execution times of the refactored script is significantly reduced vs the original code written. The run times for the refactored script were sub 0.2 seconds, where the unfactored script runtimes were in the 0.6 - 0.7 second ranges.
